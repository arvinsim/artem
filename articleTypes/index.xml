&lt;p&gt;For this week, I choose to cook a variation of an omelette that has a distinctive western taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I made Quiche using spinach and broccoli. The meal tasted great and satiated my hunger easily when I ate it for lunch and dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valentines Day is upcoming and there were a lot of coding projects that I wanted to do this week. Because of that, I wanted to cook a meal that is easy to prepare and has less green vegetables as ingredients. I was able to get a recipe from &lt;a href=&#34;http://cavemanketo.com/mini-western-omelettes/&#34;&gt;Caveman Keto&lt;/a&gt; that seems fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;differences:fb513274b0fcb8302e3b4b73088399e9&#34;&gt;Differences&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hams steak is hard to find in my place but cooked spiced ham is plenty. So I substituted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t puyt the chees the wayt that article did. In my first try, I grated the cheese and put
it as toppings on the muffin. On my second try, I cut them into little cubes and mixed them with the
batter before putting them in the oven&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;screenshots:fb513274b0fcb8302e3b4b73088399e9&#34;&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This are the result of what I did the second time around. I hope I don&amp;rsquo;t make you hungry :)&lt;/p&gt;
