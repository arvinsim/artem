I was looking for a certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founders_at_Work">book</a> that I am sure I saw before. I examined as many books that I could-going as far as inspecting the books in the lower shelves. Unfortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t able to find it.</p>

<p>Today, I was supposed to buy some groceries for my weekly meals after work. But it bugged me that I was only able to partially examine the book selection the last time I visited. So I decided to pay Booksale another visit.</p>

<p>There were 2 books that interested me. One was a book on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools">compilers</a> that is affectionaly called the &ldquo;Red Dragon Book&rdquo;. This book is worth 175Php. The other one was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Defense_of_Food">book</a> about food nutrition and diet. It piqued my interest since it was the 102th recommended book in Reddit&rsquo;s top favorite book list. This book is worth 60php.</p>

<p>It was hard choosing which one to buy. But I decided to buy the book on food for many reasons. It was cheap. It doesn&rsquo;t get as outdated as fast as technology books. I am also confident that there are free resources in the internet that is as comprehensive as the &ldquo;Red Dragon&rdquo; book.</p>
