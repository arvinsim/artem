<h2 id="why-did-you-read-the-book-what-made-you-interested-in-it:f8cd6a78e60b83800c58e39b789b8533">Why did you read the book? What made you interested in it?</h2>

<p>I discovered this book while I was reading a Reddit post about Enterprenuerial books. It was recommending good books to read for the budding entrepreneur. While I was browsing the list, this book caught my eye. I surmised that it is because of the title. It is remniscent of Sun Tzu&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War">The Art of War</a>.</p>

<p>After doing some research, I gave it a try since it is a short book.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-you-read-it:f8cd6a78e60b83800c58e39b789b8533">How did you read it?</h2>

<p>I read this book in short bursts. I don&rsquo;t have much reading time as I used to since I now have lots of hobbies and side projects to attend to. I choose my morning ride from home to the office as my reading time for this book.</p>

<p>The book consists of small sections with each section expounding on a one line idea. My morning ride consists of going to a street where a particular jeep is passing. I get off and then transfer to the jeep which takes me to my office location.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the book divisions and my transportation routine lend themselves to each other very well.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-give-a-brief-summary-of-the-book:f8cd6a78e60b83800c58e39b789b8533">Can you give a brief summary of the book?</h2>

<p>The first part of the book introduces us to the concept of <em>Resistance</em>. The author gives a definition, explains it&rsquo;s many forms and symptoms, and gives some examples of situations where <em>Resistance</em> is holding us back.</p>

<p>The second part of the book gives advice on how to deal with <em>Resistance</em>. He starts with some tips but switches his strategy by using the contrast between a <em>Professional</em> and a <em>Amateur</em>.</p>

<p>The last part of the book deals more with the metaphysical. He uses colorful terminology in his explanations for this part. For example, he uses the terms <em>muses</em> and <em>angels</em> as a designation to these mysterious forces. The rest of the book deals with how to invoke these forces, the dichotomy of the <em>ego</em> and the <em>self</em>, as well as the <em>territorial</em> and the <em>hierarchial</em></p>

<h2 id="what-insights-did-you-get-from-the-book:f8cd6a78e60b83800c58e39b789b8533">What insights did you get from the book?</h2>

<p>One of the parts where I can relates is where he says that those close to you will act strangely if you try to change your life. It can be changing careers, lifestyle, diet, etc. Some will conciously or unconciously try to sabotage you. When I tried to change my dietary methods, suffice not everyone was estatic with it. Some expressed doubts, some tried to tempt me to break my diet.</p>

<p>I also like the implication that the worst enemy of our success is ourselves. It might be depressing to think that we were holding ourselves back all long. But think of it this way, you have the power to improve yourself if you just choose to.</p>

<p>Lastly, I find the idea of the <em>Professional</em> reassuring. I am the type of person who tries to be good at whatever he is doing. Lots of advice in the <em>Professional</em> section resonate with me. I have no problem agreeing with the author in that section.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-your-recommendation:f8cd6a78e60b83800c58e39b789b8533">What is your recommendation?</h2>

<p>The first two parts of the book has some interesting ideas and information that you can use to apply to your life. They are useful when trying to get out of a rut or mental/creative block.</p>

<p>It is the third part where I think it gets less interesting. By trying to use some concepts such as muses or angels, it gives off a &ldquo;new age&rdquo; feel.</p>

<p>Not to say that it is bad. But I went to read this book for some pragmatic concepts that can be applied directly.</p>

<p>Whether you like it or not, this book is short so it is worth a try.</p>
