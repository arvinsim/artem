<h2 id="the-other-side-of-the-fence:29de3aa4c61cac74984fb82cb265c6f3">The other side of the fence</h2>

<p>I have always been fascinated with the Internet. The process of creating a website has always involved both disciplines. A beautiful website needs to exercise both the creative and logical.</p>

<p>I am only familiar with the coding side of the equation as a web developer. I haven&rsquo;t explored the visual aspects of creating a website.</p>

<p>I decided that learning the process of asset creation would benefit me. Even surface knowledge would be enough. Knowing myself, I would be happy creating things considered mundane by professional designer.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-the-method:29de3aa4c61cac74984fb82cb265c6f3">Choosing the method</h2>

<h3 id="digital-painting:29de3aa4c61cac74984fb82cb265c6f3">Digital Painting</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the obvious which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_painting">digital painting</a>. It is the most common and most versatile method of creating digital art. Why not go with this?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I would have to abstain from it right off the bat.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Financial reasons.</p>

<p>I believe that to create digital paintings, you need a drawing tablet. Unfortunately, I am too poor to afford one right now.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I will pass on this one.</p>

<h3 id="pixel-art:29de3aa4c61cac74984fb82cb265c6f3">Pixel Art</h3>

<p>I grew up with 8-bit and 16-bit video games. Most of those games at that time use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art">pixelized art</a> rather than the smooth and clean methods that we have today. This method holds some nostalgic value for me.</p>

<p>But creating it takes a lot of hard work and dedication. Resizing it to fit many resolutions is also going to be a nightmare.</p>

<p>I always smile when I see pixel art. But I will just enjoy looking at rather than creating it when it comes to the web.</p>

<h3 id="vector-art:29de3aa4c61cac74984fb82cb265c6f3">Vector Art</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics">Vector Art</a> consists of lines and gradients that are created via mathematical models rather than painting them as pixels. In the end, this is the one that I chose.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>I don&rsquo;t need to have a tablet</em>.</p>

<p>People can create amazing vector with just a mouse.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Assets created in vector art can be resized to fit any resolution</em>.</p>

<p>I will be designing sites with an eye on mobile.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Vector art lends itself well to flat design</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="choosing-what-software-to-use:29de3aa4c61cac74984fb82cb265c6f3">Choosing what software to use</h2>

<p>Based on my research, there are only really 2 contenders for this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html"><strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Pro

<ul>
<li>Industry Standard</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Con

<ul>
<li>Very Expensive</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://inkscape.org/en/"><strong>Inkscape</strong></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Pro

<ul>
<li>Free</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Con

<ul>
<li>Not a good choice if you are going for a professional career in Vector art</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Since I am just getting my feet wet with vector graphics, it is better to start with the free option.</p>

<p>Inkscape it is!</p>

<h2 id="first-vector-art:29de3aa4c61cac74984fb82cb265c6f3">First Vector Art</h2>

<p>I decided to just spice up the background of my <a href="http://arvinsim.github.io">github organization page</a> with a throwaway vector art made up of simple geometric shapes.</p>

<p>I used triangles and squares to create a simple mosaic background.</p>
