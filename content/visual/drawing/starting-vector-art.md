## The other side of the fence

I have always been fascinated with the Internet. The process of creating a website has always involved both disciplines. A beautiful website needs to exercise both the creative and logical.

I am only familiar with the coding side of the equation as a web developer. I haven't explored the visual aspects of creating a website. 

I decided that learning the process of asset creation would benefit me. Even surface knowledge would be enough. Knowing myself, I would be happy creating things considered mundane by professional designer. 

## Choosing the method

### [Digital Painting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_painting)

Let's start with the obvious which is digital painting. It is the most common and most versatile method of creating digital art. Why not go with this?

Unfortunately, I would have to abstain from it right off the bat.

Why? 

Financial reasons.

I believe that to create digital paintings, you need a drawing tablet. Unfortunately, I am too poor to afford one right now.

Unfortunately, I will pass on this one.

### [Pixel Art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art)

I grew up with 8-bit and 16-bit video games. This method holds some nostalgic value for me.

But creating it takes a lot of hard work and dedication. Resizing it to fit many resolutions is also going to be a nightmare. 

I always smile when I see pixel art. But I will just enjoy looking at rather than creating it when it comes to the web.

### [Vector Art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics)

In the end, this is the one that I chose.

- *I don't need to have a tablet*. 

    People can create amazing vector with just a mouse.

- *Assets created in vector art can be resized to fit any resolution*.

    I will be designing sites with an eye on mobile.

- *Vector art lends itself well to flat design*.

## Choosing what software to use

Based on my research, there are only really 2 contenders for this.

### [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)
- Pro
    - Industry Standard
- Con
    - Very Expensive

### [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/)
- Pro
    - Free
- Con
    - Not a good choice if you are going for a professional career in Vector art

Since I am just getting my feet wet with vector graphics, it is better to start with the free option.

Inkscape it is!

## First Vector Art

I decided to just spice up the background of my [github organization page](http://arvinsim.github.io) with a throwaway vector art made up of simple geometric shapes.

I used triangles and squares to create a simple mosaic background.
