This is an attempt to draw [Kirby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_%28character%29), a famous fictional character from Nintendo. I chose this character because it is easy to draw. But I underestimated how much time I needed to actually emulate the image. The gradients took most of my time since I am still not familiar with the software. 

I used [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) to draw and [Gpick](http://www.gpick.org/screenshots.html) to copy over the colors from the source image
