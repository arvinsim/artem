Browsing through all the books in a used books store is often a fruitless endeavor. But once a while, the search yields gems of reading material among the junk. In my case, I started out to find a book that I delayed buying since last week. I ended up buying 6 books that I never knew I wanted instead.


It has been a while since I have visited SM Booksale. Last week, I was poring through all the books to see if there are any interesting books. A hardbound copy of [The Dilbert Principle] caught my eye. This book is really well known around the tech community for its biting satire on corporate culture. I knew that this is a book that I wanted to own in the physically. But then, I discovered that the price was 170PhP was too steep for my taste. As much as I wanted to buy it, I decided it would be better to wait and come back after I could justify buying it.

Unfortunately, I never saw that book again. When I finally decided that the book was worth buying, the book was already gone. A stubborn part of me went over the books again but it cannot be found. I regretted not buying it the first time I found it.


// Main Thought: Show how regretful you were that you weren't able to buy the Dilbert book. At the end of the paragraph, contrast it a sentence that hints at how amazing your book haul for the day was.
Unfortunately, it was not meant to be. I tried to buy that back but I don't see it in the place that I left it anymore. I tried to go over all the books in the store but I can't find it anymore. I deduced that someone might have already bought it or it was shipped to another branch. I regretted not buying it last week.

But all the effort paid off. While I was going through books, I came across books that are proven to be popular. The books that are found are authored by Terry Pratchett, Bill Bryson and Daniel Kahneman 

## Terry Pratchett
// Brief description of Terry Pratchett and what makes his books compelling.
Terry Pratchett is a recently deceased author I have been meaning to check out a long time ago. The only reason I haven't checked him out is because his books don't usually show up in Booksale. In the span of 4 years, I only see [2]() [books]() by him. But now I was able to find 4 of them.

// Narrate how the books were found
I was able to procure them from the lower section part of the bookshelves. It pays to be patiently sifting through the books. You will never know what you can find in there.

## A Brief History Of Nearly Everything
// Admit that you don't know a lot of this book. Explain that you bought because of 2 things. One, it is universally recommended by people at Reddit. Two, you know that you father like historical fiction like books from James Michener. Although this book is not fiction, you heard that it was one of the most interesting history book out there.

Now I was really worried that I can't find that Dilbert book. My mind still denies the logical conclusion that someone beat me to it. I was checking out the side of bookshelve where softbound copies of health-related books are on display. I nearly missed the [A Brief History of Nearly Everything]() by [Bill Bryson]() which was hiding in plain sight. For only 75PhP for a relatively book, I think it was worth buying.

## Thinking, Fast and Slow
// Emphasize how cheap you got the book at first but then slowly explain why getting it cheap is a big deal.

While I was already on my way on finishing my purchases, my eye went to the medical section of the store which was near the counter. I was elated when I found out that [Thinking, Fast and Slow]() book was there. I called a friend of mine who already bought this book to ask how much the price is. He said it was worth 600PhP. The price marker on the book I was holding showed 155PhP.

Hesitation didn't have a chance to intervene. I included it in my haul.
