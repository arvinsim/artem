Browsing through all the books in a used books store is often a fruitless endeavor. But once a while, the search yields gems of reading material among the junk. In my case, I started out to find a book that I delayed buying since last week. I ended up buying 6 books that I never knew I wanted instead.


It has been a while since I have visited SM Booksale. Last week, I was poring through all the books to see if there are any interesting books. A hardbound copy of  [The Dilbert Principle](http://address) caught my eye. This book is really well known around the tech community for its biting satire on corporate culture. I knew that this is a book that I wanted to own in the physically. But then, I discovered that the price was 170PhP was too steep for my taste. As much as I wanted to buy it, I decided it would be better to wait and come back after I could justify buying it.

Unfortunately, I never saw that book again. When I finally decided that the book was worth buying, the book was already gone. A stubborn part of me went over the books again. But I knew after going through half of all the books again that it wasn't there anyomre. I regretted not buying it the first time I found it.

But all the crouching and <!-- verb that denotes crawling into tight spaces  --> paid off. While I was going through books, I came across books that are recommended in [Reddit](http://address), a site that I often reference for reviews. This includes books that are found are authored by Terry Pratchett, Bill Bryson and Daniel Kahneman.

## Terry Pratchett
They say that people only become more popular once they died. Terry Pratchett has become one recently. They also observed that anything related to that person will suddenly become more expensive. As someone who don't have his books, I hope you can forgive me for believing this notion and become <!-- noun that means very observant --> on any bargains on his books.

His books are available in booksale only in very <!-- adjective that means very infrequent, sparse --> amounts. I remember seeing old paperback versions of [The Colour of Magic](http://address) and [Small Gods](http://address) before in SM Booksale. Many times I also encountered the hardbound version of [Hogfather](http://address) twice in two different Booksale branches. I bought [A Hat Full of Sky](http://address) on a whim, not caring if that book is the first in the series. Now that I have acquired the information on Terry Pratchett's bibliography, it makes me sad that the most recommended books were not available in Booksale.

Combing the books in <!-- noun that means the lower area/part of a shelf/bookshelf --> in the western part of Booksale was a hassle. The books are piled in a way as to fit as many books as possible. It took a lot of time to check the books one by one. But after a while, I found a Terry Pratchett Book called [Thief of Time](http://address). I felt relieved that all the effort that I did was rewarded with at least one book.

But it did not stop there. I uncovered [Reaper Man](http://address), [The Last Continent](http://address) and [Sourcery](http://address) in quick succession in that <!-- adjective that means a suffocating small place -->. I was elated that I can finally start reading Terry's books.

## A Brief History Of Nearly Everything

// Admit that you don't know a lot of this book. Explain that you bought because of 2 things. One, it is universally recommended by people at Reddit. Two, you know that you father like historical fiction like books from James Michener. Although this book is not fiction, you heard that it was one of the most interesting history book out there.

Now I was really worried that I can't find that Dilbert book. My mind still denies the logical conclusion that someone beat me to it. I was checking out the side of bookshelve where softbound copies of health-related books are on display. I nearly missed the [A Brief History of Nearly Everything]() by [Bill Bryson]() which was hiding in plain sight. For only 75PhP for a relatively book, I think it was worth buying.

## Thinking, Fast and Slow
// Emphasize how cheap you got the book at first but then slowly explain why getting it cheap is a big deal.

While I was already on my way on finishing my purchases, my eye went to the medical section of the store which was near the counter. I was elated when I found out that [Thinking, Fast and Slow]() book was there. I called a friend of mine who already bought this book to ask how much the price is. He said it was worth 600PhP. The price marker on the book I was holding showed 155PhP.

Hesitation didn't have a chance to intervene. I included it in my haul.
