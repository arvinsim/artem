It pays to be patient when shopping in Booksale.

Last week, I was browsing Booksale. While leafing through the books, I came across the [Dilbert principle](), a book famous for its satirical commentary on corporate culture. I wanted to buy the book but the 170PhP price is not something I can just close my eyes to. I decided that it would be better to wait for a week. If I still want to buy that back, I can just go back to the store.

Unfortunately, it was not meant to be. I tried to buy that back but I don't see it in the place that I left it anymore. I tried to go over all the books in the store but I can't find it anymore. I deduced that someone might have already bought it or it was shipped to another branch. I regretted not buying it last week.

## Terry Pratchett

But all was not in vain. While I was going through the books to find the [Dilbert Principle](), I came across books by Terry Pratchett. He is a recently deceased author I have been meaning to check out a long time ago. The only reason I haven't checked him out is because his books don't usually show up in Booksale. In the span of 4 years, I only see [2]() [books]() by him. But now I was able to find 4 of them.

I was able to procure them from the lower section part of the bookshelves. It pays to be patiently sifting through the books. You will never know what you can find in there.

## A Brief History Of Nearly Everything

Now I was really worried that I can't find that Dilbert book. My mind still denies the logical conclusion that someone beat me to it. I was checking out the side of bookshelve where softbound copies of health-related books are on display. I nearly missed the [A Brief History of Nearly Everything]() by [Bill Bryson]() which was hiding in plain sight. For only 75PhP for a relatively book, I think it was worth buying.

## Thinking, Fast and Slow

While I was already on my way on finishing my purchases, my eye went to the medical section of the store which was near the counter. I was elated when I found out that [Thinking, Fast and Slow]() book was there. I called a friend of mine who already bought this book to ask how much the price is. He said it was worth 600PhP. The price marker on the book I was holding showed 155PhP.

Hesitation didn't have a chance to intervene. I included it in my haul.
