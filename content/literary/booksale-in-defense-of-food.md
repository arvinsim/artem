I was browsing the book selection of Booksale's branch in Gaisano last week. I was looking for a certain [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founders_at_Work) that I am sure I saw before. I examined as many books that I could-going as far as inspecting the books in the lower shelves. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find it.

Today, I was supposed to buy some groceries for my weekly meals after work. But it bugged me that I was only able to partially examine the book selection the last time I visited. So I decided to pay Booksale another visit.

There were 2 books that interested me. One was a book on [compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools) that is affectionaly called the "Red Dragon Book". This book is worth 175Php. The other one was a [book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Defense_of_Food) about food nutrition and diet. It piqued my interest since it was the 102th recommended book in Reddit's top favorite book list. This book is worth 60php.

It was hard choosing which one to buy. But I decided to buy the book on food for many reasons. It was cheap. It doesn't get as outdated as fast as technology books. I am also confident that there are free resources in the internet that is as comprehensive as the "Red Dragon" book.
