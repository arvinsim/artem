William Zissner

I love the simplicity and straightforwardness of this book. No grammer lessons. No oncjunctions, prepositions, etc. Just straight up writing advice on what matters outside
synttax and grammar

This book seems to be meant to be about writing nonfiction but after reading through it, I could use a lot of advice in making up stories.

This book emphasizes clarity and straightforwardness. The irony here is that up until now, I was trying to make my prose more complex. You see, I wanted to expand my vocabulary. I wanted to be able to use precise words for sepcific use. I can't do that with general terms. SO I need to learn more vocabulary. However, the side effect here is that it seems that I ten towards more opaque words to get my point across. That has the effect of making me sound condascending to the reader. This book reminded me of what matters.

I plan to read this book in the future.
