## gaudy

> brilliantly or excessively showy: *gaudy plumage.*

I could have used this word many times when people flash their wares unnecessarily.
It could also be that I was just bitter.

## tinseled

> a glittering metallic substance, as copper or brass, in thin sheets, used in pieces, strips, threads, etc., to produce a sparkling effect cheaply. 

Ornaments on a Christmas Tree are almost always tinseled rather than actual rare materials.

## rickety

> likely to fall or collapse; shaky: *a rickety chair.*
> feeble in the joints; tottering; infirm: *a rickety old man.*

This is what happened when I tried to do too much on the gym way back.

## conspicuous

> easily seen or noticed; readily visible or observable: *a conspicuous error.*
> attracting special attention, as by outstanding qualities or eccentricities: *He was conspicuous by his booming laughter.*

I never fail to know at least one person who has this quality at any given time.

## surmise

> to think or infer without certain or strong evidence; conjecture; guess. 

You can read a lot of Facebook posts that do this.

## argot

> the special vocabulary and idiom of a particular profession or social group: *sociologists' argot.*

No wonder this word sounds familiar. It sounds like a certain [place](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Argoth) in [Magic: The Gathering](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Magic:_The_Gathering) lore.
