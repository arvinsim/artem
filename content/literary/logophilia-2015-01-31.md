It has been a long time since I read some paperback from my bookshelf. I decided to take one book and try to finish it despite my preference for ebooks. I chose the [Father Brown Mysteries](http://www.amazon.com/Father-Brown-Omnibus-Preface-Auberon/dp/0396081592/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1425560311&sr=1-1&keywords=father+brown+omnibus), the most accessible writing of [G.K. Chesterton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton), one of my favorite British author and philospher.

I have read this book before but I don't remember where I stopped reading. I decided I would just pick one I haven't read before. "The Three Tools of Death" title was compelling so I went with that.
