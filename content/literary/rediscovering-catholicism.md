I am a practicing Catholic. I am a bad Catholic. That is why I keep practicing.

Joking aside, the reason I read this book is to delve more into Catholicism.

This isn't my first though and other books had more impact on me. But this was one was a good read in mobile while doing my daily commutes.

## Seven pillars of Catholic Spirituality

- Confession
- Daily Prayer
- The Mass
- The Bible
- Fasting

## Quotes that impacted to you.

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually, Who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us, it is in everyone. And as we ley our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

God has created me to do him some definite service. He has committed some work to me which he has not committed to another. I have my mission. I may never know it in this life, but I shall be told it in the next. I am a link in a chain, a bond of connection between persons. He has not created me for naught. I shall do good--I shall do his work. I shall be an angel of peace, a preacher of truth in my own place while not intending it, if I do but keep his commandments. Therefore I will trust him, whatever I am, I can never be thrown away. If I am in sickness, my sickness may serve him. In perplexity, my perplexity may serve him. If I am in sorrow, my sorrow may serve him. He does nothing in vain. He knows what he is about. He may take away my friends. He may throw me among strangers. he may make me feel desolate, make my spirits sink, hide my future from me--still, HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS ABOUT.
- Cardinal John Henry Newman

When was the last time you identified a weakness in any area of your life and then systematically set about eradicating it?

Prayer is central to the Christian experience. A Christian life is not sustainable without it, because growth in the Christian life is simply not possible without prayer. Growing in character and virtue, learning to hear the voice of God in our lives and walking where he calls us--all require the discipline of prayer. And it is not enough simply to pray when we feel like it. Prayer requires a daily commitment.

Ten minutes a day. If you are confused, angry, tired, frustrated, happy, excited, grateful...come to the silence. Stick a note on your bathroom mirror. TEN MINUTES A DAY. And every day as you brush your teeth, ask yourself, "When will I spend my ten minutes in the classroom of silence today?" Don't be deceived by the simplicity of this message. You will be amazed how much ten minutes each day in a quiet church can change your life.

I would like to suggest that once a week, perhaps on Tuesday or Wednesday, your take to read and reflect upon the coming Sunday's Gospel. Just start with the Gospel. Perhaps in time you will move on to reflect on all of the readings, but for now, just start with the Gospel. If you are married, you may wish to share this experience with your spouse. Don't just rush through it. Read next Sunday's Gospel slowly and pick out a word or a phrase that strikes you or jumps out at you. Take turns reading and then explaining which word jumped out at you. Then read through it again. Again, be attentive for a word or phrase that strikes you. Maybe it will be the same word; maybe it will be a different word. It doesn't matter. Read the passage three times. If the Word of God is to transforms us we need to allow it to sink its roots deep into our lives through repetition and reflection.

Our lives change when our habits change. Our habits change when we make resolutions, remind ourselves of those resolutions, hold ourselves accountable for them, and perform them. Sometimes we fail, but there is no success that isn't checkered with failure. Don't give up. Press on, little by little.

The birth of our son has also renewed my relationship with Mary. It has occurred to me that no matter how much I love my son, my wife will always have a unique perspective on his life. It doesn't mean that she loves him more or that I live him less. It just means that a mother sees her child's life in a way that nobody else can. If I don't take time occasionally to ask her about this motherly perspective I unnecessarily miss a part of my son's life.

When love goes sour, it is usually for one of four reasons: misunderstanding, indifference, selfishness, or th pride that makes a person unwilling to apologize or forgive. Sometimes it is a combination and usually both parties are at fault to some extent.

Change is one of the laws of the natural universe. Nature teaches us that everything of this world is constantly changing. Everything God created is constantly in the process of either growing or dying. History also teaches us that those who try to prevent or avoid change always fail.

The great fallacy of the lukewarm moral life is to believe that our sole responsibility is to eliminate vice from our lives. IN the absence of a sincere and focused effort to grow in virtue and an openness to God's will for our lives, vice will creep into our lives in the form of a hundred different self-centered and self-destructive habits.

You see, God doesn't necessarily use the most talented people, he doesn't necessarily use the people in positions of power and authority, and he doesn't necessarily use those who are the best educated. Very often education, power, authority, and talent can become the prideful impediments that keep us from doing God's work. What type of person does God always use in powerful ways? Whom has God always used throughout history to do his work in the world? The people who make themselves available to him.

This was Jesus' model. He never preached to anybody before he met their temporal needs. He healed them, comforted them, fed them, and then he shared the message with them. He met them where they were and led them to where God was calling them to be.

The primary vehicle that God wants to use to share the truth, beauty, and wisdom of his ways with the modern world is not the mass media or the Internet. The vehicle God was to use is friendship.
Friendship is the original model of evangelization, and it is the model that will triumph in the modern context. Friendship establishes trust and mutual respect, which together bring about the openness and acceptance that give bieth to vulnerable dialogue. Only then can we begin addressing the questions that every human heart longs to answer: Who am ? Where did I come from? What I am here for? How do I do it? Where am I going? Friendship is the key to evangelization.

Cervantes's counsel was this: "He who loses wealth loses much; he who loses a friend loses more; but he who loses courage loses all." Shakespeare wrote, "Virtue is bold, and the goodness ever fearful."

I submit to you that leaders will never be more or less than their soldiers' evaluation of them. This is the true efficiency report. From most of your troops you can expect courage to match your courage, guts to match your guts, endurance to match your endurance, motivation to match your motivation, esprit to match your esprit, a desire for achievement to match your achievement. You can expect a love of God, a love of country, and a love of duty to match your own. They won't mind the heat if you sweat with them, and they won't mind the cold if you shiver with them.
You see, you don't accept the trops; they were there first. They acept you. And when they do, you'll know. They won't beat drums, wave flags, or carry your off the drill field on their shoulders, but you'll know. You see, your orders will apopoint you to command. No orders, no letters, no insignia of rank can appoint you as a leader. Leadership is  an intangible thing. Leadership is developed within yourselves; and you'll get stronger as you go.

In mythology, for thousands of years it has been believed that the darkes hour is right before the dawn, and that in the hour of greatest darkness the great heroes of the new times are being born. The darkness that the Church is passing through at the moment will not last. There is a light at the end of it all.
