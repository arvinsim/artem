After being busy for about a year, I finally decided to return reading on one of my favorite British author/philosopher, [G.K. Chesterton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton). His writings are dense and take time to digest. I decided to start with his most accessible writings, his [Father Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Brown) Mysteries. I just randomly opened a page and I happened on the "The Three Tools of Death".
