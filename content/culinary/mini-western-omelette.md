It's another week and I testing another Caveman Keto Recipe.

Last time, I made a quiche using spinach and broccoli. This time I wanted something different.

I wanted something small that could be eaten in bite sized chunks. I remembered
reading something in Caveman Keto about omelettes that look like eggs.

That's it, I decided that I want to make it

## Diffferences

- Hams steak is hard to find in my place but cooked spiced ham is plenty. So I substituted.

- I didn't puyt the chees the wayt that article did. In my first try, I grated the cheese and put
it as toppings on the muffin. On my second try, I cut them into little cubes and mixed them with the
batter before putting them in the oven

## Screenshots

This are the result of what I did the second time around. I hope I don't make you hungry :)
