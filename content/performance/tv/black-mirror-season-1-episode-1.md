+ Title: **The National Anthem**
+ Episode: 1
+ Season: 1

## Description

The British Prime Minister wakes up with a call from one of his aides. He is shown a video feed informing him that the Princess was abducted by some unknown person.

They then get to the end of the video where the Princess was forced to recite the demand of the kidnapper. In a bizarre twist, the simple demand turned out to be utterly morbid. Worse, the word has gotten out about the whole incident.

With no clues as to the whereabouts of the kidnapper, will they be able to rescue the Princess before the Prime Minister gives in to the demand?

## Review

Where do I start?

I just watched the first episode and it completely blew me away! I haven't seen any TV series this decade which deals with issues raised by the digital age in a serious manner. The first episode forces you to think about social media, journalism, the public's fickleness and fascination with the morbid and even the nature of art.

No wonder some people are already dubbing it as "The Twilight Zone for the digital age".

It is a great start to a series. I'm sure I will be watching the next episodes.
