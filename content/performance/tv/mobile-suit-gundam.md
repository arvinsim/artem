# Mobile Suit Gundam


The graphics are dated. Fans of the newer Gundam series might be turned off by it.

Required viewing to understand later UC events. 

Rather than watch the series, I recommend watching the compilation movies. The movies cover all the important events
while dropping those that seem to be just filler.
