# Introduction

# Age 1: Flit Asuno

Starts slow, took me a long time to get into things. But once it got to the latest parts
of the arc, it was great.

# Age 2: Asemu Asuno

Show picks up some steam. Great pacing. The best arc IMO

# Age 3: Kio Asuno

Started great, then they turned Kio into a pacifist

# Age 4: All together

Ending was too rushed
