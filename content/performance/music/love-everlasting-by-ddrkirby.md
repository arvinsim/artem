# When the Outro came in

I was listening to this [Extra Credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHMNeNapL1E) episode when I heard this outro at the end of the video.

The title is **Love Everlasting** by *ddrkirby*. *ddrkirby* is an indie composer who happens to produce some awesome 8-bit styled music.

The song captivated me because of its strong nostalgia factor, reminiscent of the old 8-bit video game era days. It is an era where video game landscape is almost all 2D. Most of the games then have simple but catchy soundtracks that made their impression on children.

It reminds me of the original Sonic the Hedgehog(1991) soundtrack, with tunes like [Marble Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNxcJDfkrE8) and [Star Light Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fzHm23srkI).

If you are one of those players who grew up in the 90's, then give this a listen. It might lead you to pleasant stroll throught the memory lane of your childhood.
