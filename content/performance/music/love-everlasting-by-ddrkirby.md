# When the Outro came in

I was listening to this [Extra Credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHMNeNapL1E) episode when I heard this outro at the end of the video.

The title is **Love Everlasting** by *DDRkirby*, an independent composer who produces some awesome 8-bit styled music that can be listened online for free.

I was captivated by the song because it induced a strong sense of nostalgia in me. It reminded me of the old 8-bit video game era where the video game landscape is dominated by 2D technology.
Games like [Sonic the Hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%281991_video_game%29) have [similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNxcJDfkrE8) [tunes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fzHm23srkI) in their simple but catchy soundtracks that made a strong impression on the players.

If you are one of those players who grew up in the 90's, then give this a listen. It might lead you to pleasant stroll through the memory lane of your childhood.
