<h2 id="toc_1">Description</h2>

<p>The protagonist is woken up by a virtual rooster in walled room composed of screens. We are then introduced to his daily routine of cycling on a stationary bike.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Review</h2>

<p>The world here is a dystopia that reminds me of Fahrenhenit 451 and The Running Man. It also reminds me of contemporary shows like American Idol.</p>

<p>It seems that the world became fully integrated with technology. No clues were given on the state of the world outside the microscosm that the shows provide unlike films like <em>The Matrix</em>. We learn later that the stationary bikes power the electricity of the <em>Hot Shot</em> show. I assume that it probably powers all electricity in the state though.</p>

<p>The main conflict seems to be about superficiality.</p>

<p>People are bombarded daily with advertisements via the screens in their room. You can&rsquo;t look away because the advertisement pause until it can track your eyeballs looking at the screen. The show makes it clear that pornography has became legalized, accepted and ubiquitious. You can&rsquo;t also escape the reality TV show <em>Hot shots</em></p>

<p>There are lots of app</p>

<p>Consumerism, obsession with technology, mindless entertainment(especially Reality TV and &ldquo;bubblegum&rdquo; apps/video games), forced advertising(pron!), conformity and earning currency by endlessly threading on stationary bikes.</p>

<p>Superficiality all around!</p>

<p>I shudder to think of a time when studios would put a &ldquo;Rafe&rdquo; in one of their talent shows.</p>
