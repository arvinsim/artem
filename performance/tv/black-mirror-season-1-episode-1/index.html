<h2 id="toc_1">Description</h2>

<p>The British Prime Minister wakes up with a call from one of his aides. He is shown a video feed informing him that the Princess was abducted by some unknown person.</p>

<p>They then get to the end of the video where the Princess was forced to recite the demand of the kidnapper. In a bizarre twist, the simple demand turned out to be utterly morbid. Worse, the word has gotten out about the whole incident.</p>

<p>With no clues as to the whereabouts of the kidnapper, will they be able to rescue the Princess before the Prime Minister gives in to the demand?</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Review</h2>

<p>Where do I start?</p>

<p>I just watched the first episode and it completely blew me away! I haven&rsquo;t seen any TV series this decade which deals with issues raised by the digital age in a serious manner. The first episode forces you to think about social media, journalism, the public&rsquo;s fickleness and fascination with the morbid and even the nature of art.</p>

<p>No wonder some people are already dubbing it as &ldquo;The Twilight Zone for the digital age&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It is a great start to a series. I&rsquo;m sure I will be watching the next episodes.</p>
